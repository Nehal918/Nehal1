Applications of Radio Astronomy

Studying Cosmic Background Radiation – Understanding the early universe and the Big Bang.

Mapping the Milky Way – Identifying interstellar clouds and star-forming regions.

Detecting Exoplanets – Searching for planetary systems around distant stars.

Observing Black Holes and Quasars – Using radio emissions to analyze extreme environments.

SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) – Scanning the sky for possible alien signals.

2. Radio Telescopes
A radio telescope consists of three main parts:

Antenna (Dish or Array): Collects and focuses radio waves.
Receiver: Amplifies and converts signals into a usable format.
Data Processing Unit: Analyzes signals and creates radio maps.
Types of Radio Telescopes:

Single Dish: A parabolic antenna that collects signals from a broad area (e.g., Arecibo Observatory).
Radio Interferometers: Multiple dishes working together to improve resolution (e.g., Very Large Array).
Aperture Synthesis Telescopes: Uses computational techniques to simulate a large dish (e.g., ALMA)..
